The VSSL scale: A brief instructor tool for assessing students' perceived value of software to learning statistics. *Teaching Statistics, 46*(3), 152-163. [https://doi.org/10.1111/test.12374](https://doi.org/10.1111/test.12374){target=\"_blank\"}\n\n\n\n**Abstract**\n\n> The biggest difference in statistical training from previous decades is the increased use of software. However, little research examines how software impacts learning statistics. Assessing the value of software to statistical learning demands appropriate, valid, and reliable measures. The present study expands the arsenal of tools by reporting on the psychometric properties of the Value of Software to Statistical Learning (VSSL) scale in an undergraduate student sample. We propose a brief measure with strong psychometric support to assess students' perceived value of software in an educational setting. We provide data from a course using SPSS, given its wide use and popularity in the social sciences. However, the VSSL is adaptable to any statistical software, and we provide instructions for customizing it to suit alternative packages. Recommendations for administering, scoring, and interpreting the VSSL are provided to aid statistics instructors and education researchers understand how software influences students' statistical learning.\n\nThe data is available on OSF: [https://osf.io/bk7vw/](https://osf.io/bk7vw/){target=\"_blank\"}\n\n\n\n**Changes made to the dataset**\n\n* We converted the Excel file into a CSV file.\n* We aggregated the main scales (columns 50-57) by reverse-scoring all reverse-coded items (as specified in the codebook), and then computed an average score for each scale.\n* However, responses to the individual questionnaire items (columns 1-49) remain as raw data and have not been reverse-coded. If you’d like to practice your data-wrangling skills, feel free to do so!\n* We tidied the columns `RaceEthE`, `GradesE`, and `MajorE`, but we’ve left Gender and Student Status for you to clean.\n\n\n## Activity 2: Load in the library, read in the data, and familiarise yourself with the data\n\nToday, we will be using the packages `tidyverse`, `performance`, and `pwr`, along with the dataset `Alter_2024_data.csv`.\n\n\n```{r eval=FALSE}\n???\n\ndata_alter <- ???\n\n```\n\n\n```{r include=FALSE, message=TRUE}\n## I basically have to have 2 code chunks since I tell them to put the data files next to the project, and mine are in a separate folder called data - unless I'll turn this into a fixed path\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(performance)\nlibrary(pwr)\ndata_alter <- read_csv(\"data/Alter_2024_data.csv\")\n```\n\n\n::: {.callout-caution collapse=\"true\" icon=\"false\"} \n\n## Solution \n\n```{r eval=FALSE}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(performance)\nlibrary(pwr)\ndata_alter <- read_csv(\"Alter_2024_data.csv\")\n```\n\n:::\n\nAs always, take a moment to familiarise yourself with the data before starting your analysis.\n\n::: {.callout-note icon=\"false\"}\n\n## Your Turn\n\nQuick check: Have you familiarised yourself with the data?

This means we're all set for this week.\n\nHowever, working with a smaller subset of the data will be beneficial. Select the relevant variables of interest and store the results in a new data object called `data_alter_reduced`.\n\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\" icon=\"false\"} \n\n## Hints\n\nOf course, you have identified the variables Quantitative self-efficacy (`Mean_QSE`) and the VSSL Scale: Value of Software to Learning Statistics (`Mean_SPSS`). \n\nBut did you remember that we also need the participant ID (`StudentIDE`)?\n\n\n::: {.callout-caution collapse=\"true\" icon=\"false\"} \n\n## Solution\n\n```{r}\ndata_alter_reduced <- data_alter %>% \n  select(StudentIDE, Mean_QSE, Mean_SPSS)\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n:::\n\n\n::: {.callout-important collapse=\"true\" icon=\"false\"}\n## Extra Activity - recoding Gender and Student Status\n\n::: {.callout-tip collapse=\"true\" icon=\"false\"}\n\n## Challenge yourself: Easy (recoding Gender)\n\nRecode column `GenderE` so the values read \"Female\", \"Male\", and \"Non-Binary\" instead of 1, 2, and 3. Use the codebook to guide you. We have done this quite a few times now, but if you need a hint, recoding values was covered in @sec-wrangling2_act3.\n\nMight as well turn `Gender` into a factor while we are at it.\n\n::: {.callout-caution collapse=\"true\" icon=\"false\"}\n\n## Solution for Gender\n\n```{r eval=FALSE}\ndata_alter <- data_alter %>% \n  mutate(Gender = case_match(GenderE,\n                             1 ~ \"Female\",\n                             2 ~ \"Male\",\n                             3 ~ \"Non-Binary\"),\n         Gender = factor(Gender))\n  \n```\n:::\n\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {.callout-warning collapse=\"true\" icon=\"false\"}\n\n## Challenge yourself: A bit harder (recoding Student Status)\n\nHowever, recoding Student Status is a bit more tricky. There appear to be numbers and different ways of spelling.\n\nTo capture all of them, we will need to know the distinct categories fist. We have used the `distinct()` function briefly in previous chapters. Time to use it once more.\n\n::: {.callout-caution collapse=\"true\" icon=\"false\"} \n\n## Solution to identify distinct categories\n\n```{r}\ndata_alter %>% \n  distinct(StuStaE)\n```\n\n:::\n\nNow that we have identified the distinct values of column `StuStaE`, we can use a conditional statement to recode those distinct categories to obtain the categorical labels in the codebook. \n\nDo you remember how conditional recoding is done? If not, get some inspiration from @sec-wrangling2_act4.\n\n::: {.callout-caution collapse=\"true\" icon=\"false\"}\n\n## Solution for Student Status: Option 1\n\nYou could only recode the values that are \"incorrect\", i.e., converting the numbers into labels and grouping together everyone who falls into the category \"Senior or Higher\".\n\nAs `Student_Status` is an ordinal variable, we should turn it into a factor to order the categories accordingly.\n\n```{r eval=FALSE}\ndata_alter <- data_alter %>% \n  mutate(Student_Status = case_when(\n    StuStaE == \"2\" ~ \"Sophomore\",\n    StuStaE == \"3\" ~ \"Junior\",\n    StuStaE %in% c(\"4\", \"Senior\", \"senior\", \"post-bac\") ~ \"Senior or Higher\",\n    .default = StuStaE\n  )) %>% \n  mutate(Student_Status = factor(Student_Status,\n                                 levels = c(\"Freshman\", \"Sophomore\", \"Junior\", \"Senior or Higher\")))\n```\n\n:::\n\n\n::: {.callout-caution collapse=\"true\" icon=\"false\"}\n## Solution for Student Status: Option 2\n\nYou could also recode all the labels whether they are already correctly spelled or not, if that seems more intuitive to you. You could leave out the `.default` argument this way. Yet, you'd still have to group everyone who falls into the category \"Senior or Higher\". Perhaps, a bit more writing overall, but the same outcome.\n\nI will label the newly recoded columns differently, so you'll see that both ways get you the same outcome.\n\n```{r eval=FALSE}\ndata_alter <- data_alter %>% \n  mutate(StuSta_tidy = case_when(\n           StuStaE %in% c(\"1\", \"Freshman\") ~ \"Freshman\",\n           StuStaE %in% c(\"2\", \"Sophomore\") ~ \"Sophomore\",\n           StuStaE %in% c(\"3\", \"Junior\") ~ \"Junior\",\n           StuStaE %in% c(\"4\", \"Senior\", \"senior\", \"post-bac\") ~ \"Senior or Higher\"),\n         StuSta_tidy = factor(StuSta_tidy,\n                              levels = c(\"Freshman\", \"Sophomore\", \"Junior\", \"Senior or Higher\")))\n```\n\n:::\n\n:::\n\n:::\n\n## Activity 4: Compute descriptives\n\nNow, we can calculate the **means** and **standard deviations** for our predictor and outcome variables.\n\n::: {.callout-caution collapse=\"true\" icon=\"false\"} \n\n## Solution\n\n\n```{r}\ndescriptives <- data_alter_reduced %>%\n  summarise(mean_QSE = mean(Mean_QSE, na.rm = TRUE),\n            sd_QSE = sd(Mean_QSE, na.rm = TRUE),\n            mean_SPSS = mean(Mean_SPSS, na.rm = TRUE),\n            sd_SPSS = sd(Mean_SPSS, na.rm = TRUE))\n```\n\n:::\n\n## Activity 5: Create an appropriate plot\n\nNow, let's ***re***create the following appropriate plot using `data_alter_reduced`:\n\n```{r echo=FALSE}\nggplot(data_alter_reduced, aes(x = Mean_QSE, y = Mean_SPSS)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\")\n```\n\n::: {.callout-caution collapse=\"true\" icon=\"false\"} \n\n## Solution\n\n```{r fig.keep = 'none', warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}\nggplot(data_alter_reduced, aes(x = Mean_QSE, y = Mean_SPSS)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\")\n```\n\n:::\n\n\n## Activity 6: Check assumptions\n\n\n#### Assumption 1: Levels of measurement {.unnumbered}\n\n* The **outcome variable** must be interval/ratio (continuous)\n* The **predictor variable** must be either interval/ratio (continuous) or categorical (with two levels)\n\nIn our case, both the predictor variable (Quantitative self-efficacy) and the outcome variable (Attitudes toward SPSS as measured by the VSSL Scale) are continuous. The assumption holds.\n\n\n\n#### Assumption 2: Independence of cases/observations {.unnumbered}\n\nWe must assume that each **observation is independent of the others**, meaning that each score comes from a different participant. Like assumption 1, this assumption is determined by the study design and it holds.\n\n\n#### Assumption 3: Non-zero variance {.unnumbered}\n\nSimply put, we need to have some spread in the data. The **variance must be greater than zero**. \n\nWe can check this by looking at the scatterplot: both the x-axis (predictor) and y-axis (outcome) should show variability. Similarly, we computed standard deviations for both variables in Activity 4, and both of them had values different to 0. So this assumption holds as well.\n\n\n\n\n#### Assumption 4: Linearity {.unnumbered}\n\nSince we will need the linear model for the next few assumptions and later for inferential statistics, we should first save it to the `Global Environment` as an object called `mod`.\n\nThe linear model function `lm()` requires the following arguments:\n\n* The outcome variable, followed by a tilde (`~`), followed by the the predictor variable\n* The dataset\n\n```{r}\nmod <- lm(Mean_SPSS~Mean_QSE, data = data_alter_reduced)\n```\n\n\n\nNow we can continue with the assumption check of linearity. The relationship between the two variables must be linear.\n\nWe can assess linearity visually, just as we did in the correlation chapter, by using a **Residuals vs Fitted plot**. We can use the `plot()` function on our linear model (`mod`) with the which argument set to 1. \n\n```{r}\nplot(mod, which = 1)\n```\n\n\n**Verdict:** The red line is roughly horizontal and flat, indicating that the relationship between the predictor and outcome is linear. This assumption holds.\n\n\n#### Assumption 5: Normality {.unnumbered}\n\nResiduals for both variables should follow a **bivariate normal distribution** (i.e., both together normally distributed). \n\nWe can visually check this assumption using a **Q-Q plot**. To generate it, we use the `plot()` function on our linear model `mod`, setting the `which` argument to 2. Again, this is the same approach we used in the correlation chapter to check for normality.\n\n```{r}\nplot(mod, which = 2)\n```\n\n**Verdict:** Doesn't this look beautiful? ✨ The points closely follow the diagonal line, indicating that the assumption of normality holds.\n\n\n\n#### Assumption 6: Homoscedasticity {.unnumbered}\n\nHomoscedasticity assumes that the **spread of residuals is consistent** across all levels of the predictor variable, meaning that the data is evenly distributed around the line of best fit, with no visible pattern. We can assess this assumption visually using a **Scale-Location plot**.\n\n\nTo generate it, we use the `plot()` function on our linear model `mod`, setting the `which` argument to 3:\n\n```{r}\nplot(mod, which = 3)\n```\n\n\n**Verdict:** The variance of the residual is constant along the values of predictor variable as indicated by this roughly flat and horizontal red line. Hence, we consider this assumption met.\n\n\n\n\n#### Checking Assumptions Differently: Using `check_model()` from the `performance` package {.unnumbered}\n\nAssumptions 4-6 can also be tested using the `check_model()` function from the `performance` package. This function provides the same diagnostic checks as `plot()`, but with a cleaner presentation and useful reminders of what to look for.\n\n```{r}\ncheck_model(mod)\n```\n\nOne key difference is that you get a posterior predictive check, which compares observed values to the model's predictions. Additionally, the Q-Q plot for normality of residuals is displayed different. Instead of a diagonal reference line, residuals are plotted as deviations from a horizontal line. This visualisation can sometimes exaggerate small deviations, so focus on identifying clear overall patterns rather than minor fluctuations.\n\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\n\nThe diagnostic plots in the `performance` package are generated using `ggplot2`, so you can save them using `ggsave()` if needed.\n:::\n\n\nBut again; all assumptions are met. Let's move on to inferential statistics!\n\n\n## Activity 7: Compute the regression, confidence intervals, and effect size\n\nThe `lm()` function from Base R is the main function to estimate a ***L***inear ***M***odel (hence the function name `lm`). And if you’re experiencing a hint of déjà vu, you’re onto something! We have actually already used this function to store our linear model for assumption checks (remember the object called `mod`???).\n\nJust to recap, the `lm()` function uses formula syntax with the following arguments:\n\n```{r eval=FALSE}\nlm(OutcomeVariable ~ PredictorVariable, data)\n```\n\nFor our example, the variables are:\n\n* IV (Predictor): Quantitative self-efficacy, and\n* DV (Outcome): Attitudes toward SPSS (measured by the VSSL Scale)\n\nThus, our regression model is:\n\n```{r}\nmod <- lm(Mean_SPSS~Mean_QSE, data = data_alter_reduced)\n```\n\n\nAs you can see in the `Global Environment`, `mod` stores a list of 12 elements, containing quite a bit of information about the regression model.\n\nTo view the results of our simple linear regression, use the `summary()` function on the `mod` object:\n\n```{r}\nsummary(mod)\n```\n::: {.callout-note}\n## Does it matter if the slope is positive or negative?\n\nWhen working with a continuous predictor, the sign of the slope is important to consider:\n\n* A positive slope indicates that as the predictor increases, the outcome variable also tends to increase.\n* A negative slope means that as the predictor increases, the outcome variable tends to decrease.\n\nUnderstanding the direction of the relationship is crucial for correctly interpreting the regression coefficient.\n\n:::\n\nSooo. We already have several key values, but we still need confidence intervals and effect sizes to fully report our results.\n\nR has a built-in function called `confint()` to calculate **confidence intervals** using our linear model object `mod`.\n\n\n```{r}\nconfint(mod)\n```\nThe **effect size** for a simple linear regression is Cohen's $f^2$. We can calculate it manually. As you may recall from the lectures, the formula for Cohen's $f^2$ is:\n\n$$\nf^2 = \\frac{R^2_{Adjusted}}{1-R^2_{Adjusted}}\n$$\n\nIn our case, we can extract $R^2_{Adjusted}$ from the `summary(mod)` output.\n\n```{r}\nr_sq_adj <- summary(mod)$adj.r.squared\n```\n\nAnd then, we just use `r_sq_adj` in the formula above:\n\n```{r}\nf_2 <- r_sq_adj/(1-r_sq_adj)\n\nf_2\n```\n\nNow, we have all the necessary values to write up the results!\n\n\n## Activity 8: Sensitivity power analysis\n\nAs usual, we can calculate the smallest effect size that our study was able to detect, given our design and sample size.\n\nTo do this, we use the `pwr.f2.test()` function from the `pwr` package. This function requires the following arguments:\n\n\n* `u` = Numerator degrees of freedom. This the number of coefficients you have in your model (minus the intercept)\n* `v` = Denominator degrees of freedom. This is calculated as $v=n-u-1$, where $n$ is the number of participants.\n* `f2` = The effect size. Here we are solving the effect size, so this parameter is left out\n* `sig.level` = The significance level of your study\n* `power` = The power level of your study\n\n\n```{r}\npwr.f2.test(u = 1, v = 179, sig.level = 0.05, power = 0.8)\n```\n\nWith the design and sample size we have, we could have detected an effect as small as $f^2 = 0.044$. Since the observed effect size from our inferential statistics was larger ($f^2 = 0.080$), this means our test was sufficiently powered to detect the observed effect. \n\n\n## Activity 9: The write-up\n\nA simple linear regression was performed with Attitudes toward SPSS $(M = 3.50, SD = 0.73)$ as the outcome variable and Quantitative self-efficacy $(M = 3.39, SD = 0.78)$ as the predictor variable. \n\nThe results of the regression indicated that the model significantly predicted Attitudes toward SPSS $(F(1, 179) = 15.47 p < .001, R^2_{Adjusted} = .074, f^2 = 0.080)$, accounting for 7.4% of the variance. The effect of Quantitative self-efficacy was statistically significant, positive, and of small magnitude $(b = 0.26, 95\\% CI = [.13, .40], p <.001)$. Therefore, we reject the null hypothesis in favour of H~1~. The analysis was sufficiently powered to detect this effect.\n\n\n\n## [Test your knowledge]{style=\"color: #F39C12; text-transform: uppercase;\"} {.unnumbered}\n\n\n#### Question 1 {.unnumbered}\n\n**What is the main purpose of a simple regression analysis?**\n\n`r longmcq(sample(c(answer = \"To predict or explain changes in an outcome variable based on changes in a predictor variable.\", x = \"To determine whether there is an association between two variables, without assuming causality.\", x = \"To compare means between two groups and determine if they are significantly different.\", x = \"To assess whether multiple independent variables jointly predict an outcome variable.\")))`\n\n::: {.callout-caution collapse=\"true\" icon=\"false\"}\n\n## Explain this answer\n\nSimple regression is used to model the relationship between one predictor and one outcome variable and to determine how well the predictor explains variations in the outcome. While correlation measures association and t-tests compare means, regression specifically focuses on prediction or explanation. Multiple regression involves more than one predictor.\n\n:::\n\n#### Question 2 {.unnumbered}\n\n**A sports scientist wants to examine whether an athlete’s reaction time (in milliseconds) can predict their sprint speed (in seconds) in a 100m race.**\n\n**Which of the following correctly specifies the simple regression model in R?**\n\n`r longmcq(sample(c(answer = \"lm(Sprint_Speed ~ Reaction_Time, data = data)\", x = \"lm(Reaction_Time ~ Sprint_Speed, data = data)\", x = \"lm(Sprint_Speed ~ Reaction_Time + Training_Hours, data = data)\", x = \"lm(Reaction_Time ~ Sprint_Speed + Age, data = data)\")))`\n\n::: {.callout-caution collapse=\"true\" icon=\"false\"}\n\n## Explain this answer\n\nIn a simple regression model, the outcome variable (dependent variable, DV) should be placed first, followed by the tilde (~), and then the predictor variable (independent variable, IV). That's why the correct solution is `Sprint_Speed ~ Reaction_Time`.\n\nIn one of the options, the variables were reversed,  treating sprint speed as the predictor and reaction time as the outcome variable.\n\nThe other 2 options incorrectly include multiple predictors, which would make this a multiple regression model.\n\n:::\n\n\n#### Question 3 {.unnumbered}\n\n**In a simple regression model where reaction time (milliseconds) predicts sprint speed (seconds), the regression output shows:**\n\n$$\nSprint Speed = 10.2 + 0.08 × Reaction Time\n$$\n\n**How should the slope be interpreted?**\n\n`r longmcq(sample(c(answer = \"A 1-millisecond increase in reaction time is associated with a 0.08-second increase in sprint speed.\", x = \"A 1-millisecond increase in reaction time is associated with a 0.08-second decrease in sprint speed.\", x = \"A 1-millisecond increase in reaction time is associated with a 10.2-second increase in sprint speed.\", x = \"A 1-millisecond increase in reaction time is associated with a 10.2-second decrease in sprint speed.\")))`\n\n::: {.callout-caution collapse=\"true\" icon=\"false\"}\n\n## Explain this answer\n\nThe slope (0.08), not the intercept (10.2), tells us the expected change in the outcome variable (sprint speed) for a one-unit increase in the predictor (reaction time). Since the coefficient is positive, it indicates that slower reaction times (higher values) are associated with slower sprint speeds (higher times).\n\n:::\n\n\n\n#### Question 4 {.unnumbered}\n\n**A simple regression analysis finds an $R^2_{Adjusted} = 0.62$ when predicting sprint speed from reaction time. What does this mean?**\n\n`r longmcq(sample(c(answer = \"62% of the variance in sprint speed is explained by reaction time.\", x = \"62% of the variance in reaction time is explained by sprint speed.\", x = \"The predictor fully explains the outcome.\", x = \"The model does not fit well because the adjusted $R^2$ is too high.\")))`\n\n::: {.callout-caution collapse=\"true\" icon=\"false\"}\n\n## Explain this answer\n\nAdjusted $R^2$ represents the proportion of variance in the dependent variable (sprint speed) that is explained by the independent variable (reaction time). A value of 0.62 means that 62% of the differences in sprint speed can be accounted for by reaction time, indicating a strong predictive relationship.\n\nThe other options are incorrect:\n\n* One of the options reverses the outcome variable and the predictor. Since the DV is sprint speed, we cannot say that 62% of reaction time is explained by sprint speed.\n\n* A high $R^2$ adjusted does not mean the predictor fully explains the outcome. Some variability ($1 - R^2_{Adjusted} = 38\\%$) remains unexplained, meaning other factors beyond reaction time contribute to sprint speed. A perfect model would have ($R^2 = 1.00$), which is almost never the case in real data.\n\n* A high $R^2$ adjusted does not mean the model is bad. In fact, 0.62 is quite strong, meaning the model fits the data well. A high can sometimes be concerning if it’s unexpectedly large (e.g., above 0.90 in social sciences), but here it may simply indicate a strong
