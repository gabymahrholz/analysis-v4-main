A “Present” for the Future: The Unexpected Value of Rediscovery.  *Psychological Science, 25*(10), 1851-1860. [https://doi.org/10.1177/0956797614542274](https://doi.org/10.1177/0956797614542274){target=\"_blank\"}\n\n\n\n\n**Abstract**\n\n> Although documenting everyday activities may seem trivial, four studies reveal that creating records of the present generates unexpected benefits by allowing future rediscoveries. In Study 1, we used a time-capsule paradigm to show that individuals underestimate the extent to which rediscovering experiences from the past will be curiosity provoking and interesting in the future. In Studies 2 and 3, we found that people are particularly likely to underestimate the pleasure of rediscovering ordinary, mundane experiences, as opposed to extraordinary experiences. Finally, Study 4 demonstrates that underestimating the pleasure of rediscovery leads to time-inconsistent choices: Individuals forgo opportunities to document the present but then prefer rediscovering those moments in the future to engaging in an alternative fun activity. Underestimating the value of rediscovery is linked to people’s erroneous faith in their memory of everyday events. By documenting the present, people provide themselves with the opportunity to rediscover mundane moments that may otherwise have been forgotten.\n\nThe data is available on OSF: [https://osf.io/t2wby/](https://osf.io/t2wby/){target=\"_blank\"}\n\n\nIn summary, the researchers were interested in whether people could accurately predict how interested they would be in revisiting past experiences. They referred to this as the “time capsule” effect, where individuals store photos or messages to remind themselves of past events in the future. The researchers predicted that participants in the *ordinary* condition would underestimate their future feelings (i.e., show a greater difference between time 1 and time 2 ratings) compared to those in the *extraordinary* condition.\n\n\n**Changes made to the dataset**\n\n* The original SPSS file was converted to CSV format. Columns are already tidied.\n* No other changes were made.\n\n\n## Activity 2: Load in the library, read in the data, and familiarise yourself with the data\n\nToday, we will use several packages: `afex`, `tidyverse`, `performance`, `emmeans`, and `effectsize`. \n\nWe also need to read in the dataset `Zhang_2014_Study3.csv` \n\n\n\n```{r eval=FALSE}\n???\n\ndata_zhang <- ???\n```\n\n\n```{r include=FALSE, message=TRUE}\n## I basically have to have 2 code chunks since I tell them to put the data files next to the project, and mine are in a separate folder called data - unless I'll turn this into a fixed path\nlibrary(afex)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(performance)\nlibrary(emmeans)\nlibrary(effectsize)\n\ndata_zhang <- read_csv(\"data/Zhang_2014_Study3.csv\")\n\nzhang_data <- data_zhang %>% \n  filter(T2_Finished == \"Yes\") %>% \n  mutate(Participant_ID = row_number(),\n         Condition = factor(Condition)) %>% \n  select(Participant_ID, Gender, Age, Condition, `Time 1` = T1_Pred_Interest_Comp, `Time 2` = T2_Interest_Comp)\n\nzhang_long <- zhang_data %>% \n  pivot_longer(cols = `Time 1`:`Time 2`,\n               names_to = \"Time_Point\",\n               values_to = \"Interest_Composite_Score\")\n```\n\n\n::: {.callout-caution collapse=\"true\" icon=\"false\"} \n\n## Solution \n\n```{r eval=FALSE}\nlibrary(afex)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(performance)\nlibrary(emmeans)\nlibrary(effectsize)\n\ndata_zhang <- read_csv(\"Zhang_2014_Study3.csv\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Activity 3: Preparing the dataframe\n\nThis is a 2 x 2 mixed factorial ANOVA, with one within-subjects factor (time: time 1 vs. time 2) and one between-subjects factor (type of event: ordinary vs. extraordinary).\n\nSo let's start by wrangling the data we need for today's analysis:\n\n* Only include participants who completed the questionnaire at both time point 1 and time point 2.\n* Add a column called `Participant_ID`. *We did that last week.*\n* Convert the column `Condition` into a factor.\n* Select the following columns \n  * `Participant_ID`\n  * `Gender`\n  * `Age`\n  * `Condition`\n  * The *predicted* interest composite score at time point 1 `T1_Pred_Interest_Comp` and relabel it as `Time 1`\n  * The *actual* interest composite score at time point 2 `T2_Interest_Comp` and relabel it as `Time 2`\n* Store the cleaned dataset as `zhang_data`.\n\nWe should also create a long format version `zhang_long` that stores the interest composite scores for time points 1 and 2 in a single column (see excerpt below). Obviously `zhang_long` should have data from all 130 participants, not just the first 3.\n\n```{r echo=FALSE}\nzhang_long %>% \n  head(n = 6)\n```\n\n\n\n::: {.callout-caution collapse=\"true\" icon=\"false\"} \n\n## Solution \n\n```{r eval=FALSE}\nzhang_data <- data_zhang %>% \n  filter(T2_Finished == \"Yes\") %>% \n  mutate(Participant_ID = row_number(),\n         Condition = factor(Condition)) %>% \n  select(Participant_ID, Gender, Age, Condition, `Time 1` = T1_Pred_Interest_Comp, `Time 2` = T2_Interest_Comp)\n\nzhang_long <- zhang_data %>% \n  pivot_longer(cols = `Time 1`:`Time 2`,\n               names_to = \"Time_Point\",\n               values_to = \"Interest_Composite_Score\")\n```\n\n:::\n\n\n## Activity 4: Compute descriptives\n\nNow, we can calculate the number of participants in each group, as well as means, and standard deviations for each level of IV, and for both IVs overall.\n\nBonus: round the numbers to 2 decimal places \n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\" icon=\"false\"}\n## Hints\n\n* You cannot do this all in one go. One option is to compute all required variables for Time, Condition, and grouped by Time and Condition separately, and then combine all dataframes.\n* The final output should contain 8 observations and 5 variables.\n* To round the values, use the `round()` function by wrapping it around the `mean()` and `sd()` functions.\n\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-caution collapse=\"true\" icon=\"false\"}\n\n## Solution\n\n```{r}\n## grouped output\ndescriptives <- zhang_long %>%\n  group_by(Condition, Time_Point) %>%\n  summarise(n = n(),\n            mean = round(mean(Interest_Composite_Score), 2), \n            sd = round(sd(Interest_Composite_Score), 2)) %>% \n  ungroup()\n\ndescriptives_T <- zhang_long %>%\n  group_by(Time_Point) %>%\n  summarise(n = n(),\n            mean = round(mean(Interest_Composite_Score), 2), \n            sd = round(sd(Interest_Composite_Score), 2)) %>% \n  ungroup() %>% \n  mutate(Condition = \"all\")\n\ndescriptives_C <- zhang_long %>%\n  group_by(Condition) %>%\n  summarise(n = n(),\n            mean = round(mean(Interest_Composite_Score), 2), \n            sd = round(sd(Interest_Composite_Score), 2)) %>% \n  ungroup() %>% \n  mutate(Time_Point = \"all\")\n\ndescriptives <- descriptives %>% \n  full_join(descriptives_T) %>% \n  full_join(descriptives_C)\n```\n:::\n\n## Activity 5: Create an appropriate plot\n\nTry to recreate the following violin-boxplot. See how many features you can replicate before checking the code. The colour palette might be a bit tricky, but the rest should be fairly straightforward.\n\n\n```{r echo=FALSE}\nggplot(zhang_long, aes(x = Condition, y = Interest_Composite_Score, fill = Condition)) +\n  geom_violin(alpha = 0.4) + \n  geom_boxplot(width = 0.5, alpha = 0.8) +\n  facet_wrap(~ Time_Point) +\n  theme_classic() +\n  scale_fill_manual(values=rainbow(2),\n                    guide = \"none\") +\n  labs(y = \"Interest Composite Score\")\n```\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\" icon=\"false\"}\n## Hint for the colour palette\n\nThe colour palette used here is one we haven’t explored yet. It’s called `rainbow()` and is a built-in palette in BaseR. To apply it, you can define it as the values argument within the `scale_fill_manual()` function.\n\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-caution collapse=\"true\" icon=\"false\"}\n\n## Solution\n\n```{r eval=FALSE}\nggplot(zhang_long, aes(x = Condition, y = Interest_Composite_Score, fill = Condition)) +\n  geom_violin(alpha = 0.4) + \n  geom_boxplot(width = 0.5, alpha = 0.8) +\n  facet_wrap(~ Time_Point) +\n  theme_classic() +\n  scale_fill_manual(values=rainbow(2),\n                    guide = \"none\") +\n  labs(y = \"Interest Composite Score\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Activity 6: Store the ANOVA model and check assumptions\n\n### The ANOVA model\n\nThis week, we will use the `aov_ez()` function from the `afex` package to run our analysis and save the model. The arguments are very similar to the `anova_test()` function we used last week, so the switch should feel familiar. However, while `anova_test()` does run the anova, somehow it doesn’t store the full model object properly when defining the arguments manually. As that makes it difficult to run post-hoc tests or check assumptions, we are switching to `aov_ez()` to give ourselves more flexibility for assumption checks and follow-up analyses.\n\n\nThe `aov_ez()` function requires the following arguments:\n\n```{r eval=FALSE}\naov_ez(id = \"NULL\",\n       data = NULL, \n       between = \"NULL\", \n       within = \"NULL\",\n       dv = \"NULL\", \n       type = 3,\n       anova_table = list(es = \"NULL\"))  \n```\n\n* `id` = The column name of the participant identifier (factor).\n* `data` = The data object.\n* `between` = The between-subjects factor variable(s).\n* `within` = The within-subjects factor variable(s).\n* `dv` = The dependent variable (DV; numeric).\n* `type` = The type of sums of squares for ANOVA (here we need Type 3).\n* `anova_table = list(es = \"NULL\")` specifies the effect size to compute (here we set \"NULL\" to \"pes\" for partial eta squared).\n\n\nNow define the parameters for your analysis based on our current dataset. Check the solution when you're done. Store the model in an object called `mod`.\n\n::: {.callout-caution collapse=\"true\" icon=\"false\"}\n\n## Solution\n\n```{r}\nmod <- aov_ez(id = \"Participant_ID\",\n       data = zhang_long, \n       between = \"Condition\", \n       within = \"Time_Point\",\n       dv = \"Interest_Composite_Score\", \n       type = 3,\n       anova_table = list(es = \"pes\"))\n```\n\n:::\n\n\n\n###  Assumption checks\n\nThe assumptions for a factorial ANOVA are the same as the one-way ANOVA.\n\n#### Assumption 1: Continuous DV {.unnumbered}\n\nThe dependent variable (DV) must be measured at the interval or ratio level. In our case, this assumption is met.\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\n## Deep Dive: Ordinal data\n\nOrdinal data are commonly found in psychology, especially in the form of Likert scales. The challenge is that ordinal data are **not** interval or ratio data. They consist of a fixed set of ordered categories (e.g., the points on a Likert scale), but we can’t assume the distances between those points are equal. For example, is the difference between *strongly agree* and *agree* really the same as the difference between *agree* and *neutral*?\n\nTechnically, we shouldn’t use ANOVA to analyse ordinal data. *But in practice, almost everyone does*. A common justification is that when you average multiple Likert-scale items, the resulting composite score can be treated as interval data and may approximate a normal distribution.\n\nOthers argue that non-parametric tests or more advanced models like ordinal regression are more appropriate for ordinal data. However, this is beyond the scope of what we cover in this course. \n\nWhichever approach you choose, the key is to **understand the data you have** and be able to **justify your analytical decision**.\n:::\n\n\n#### Assumption 2: Data are independent {.unnumbered}\n\nThis assumption holds due to the study design; each participant provided responses independently.\n\n\n#### Assumption 3: Normality {.unnumbered}\n\nThe residuals of the DV should be normally distributed.\n\nThis assumption can be checked using the `check_model()` function from the `performance` package.\n\n```{r}\ncheck_model(mod)\n```\n\nAs we can see here, the assumption is met. The residuals are approximately normally distributed. In both normality plots displayed, you can see they fall close to the horizontal reference line, and the density plot shows a roughly bell-shaped distribution.\n\n\n\n#### Assumption 4: Homoscedasticity {.unnumbered}\n\nThe variances across groups should be approximately equal.\n\nWe can test this using the `check_homogeneity()` function from the `performance` package. Simply run it on your model object `mod`. This function uses Levene’s Test to assess whether the variances across all four groups (i.e., the cells of our 2 × 2 design) are roughly equal:\n\n```{r}\ncheck_homogeneity(mod, method = \"levene\")\n```\n\nYou can also visualise the results:\n\n```{r}\nplot(check_homogeneity(mod, method = \"levene\"))\n```\n\n\nIn this case, the non-significant p-value suggests that the variances across the four groups are roughly equal. The assumption is therefore met. This is also evident from the plot, which shows relatively similar spread across groups.\n\n\n## Activity 7: Compute a mixed factorial ANOVA\n\nSince we already stored the model above, all that’s left is to run the output. To view the ANOVA results, simply call the model object:\n\n```{r}\nmod\n```\n\nLook at the results, and answer the following questions:\n\n* Is the main effect of Condition significant? `r mcq(c(\"Yes\", answer = \"No\"))`\n* Is the main effect of Time significant? `r mcq(c(answer = \"Yes\", \"No\"))`\n* Is the two-way interaction significant? `r mcq(c(answer = \"Yes\", \"No\"))`\n\n\n## Activity 8: Compute post-hoc tests, an interaction plot, and effect sizes\n\n### Post-hoc comparisons\n\n#### Main effect of Time Point\n\nWe do not need to run `emmeans()` for a post hoc comparison, because `Time_Point` only has 2 levels. \n\nHowever, seeing that Zhang et al. report Confidence Intervals in their final write-up and we didn't calculate them earlier, we could use `emmeans()` to achieve that quickly.\n\n```{r}\nemmeans(mod, ~ Time_Point)\n```\n\n\n#### Interaction of Time Point and Condition\n\nBecause the interaction is significant, we should follow up with post hoc tests using the `emmeans()` function to determine which specific group comparisons are driving the effect. If the interaction is not significant, there is no justification for conducting these post hoc tests.\n\nThe `emmeans()` function requires you to specify the model object, and then the factors you want to contrast, here our interaction term (`Time_Point*Condition`).\n\n```{r}\nemmeans(mod, ~ Time_Point*Condition)\n```\n\nThis gives us the estimated marginal means for each combination of the two independent variables. As you can see, these values match the descriptives we computed earlier. However, we still need to compute the contrasts to determine which comparisons are statistically significant.\n\nWe can use the `contrast()` function, piped onto the output of `emmeans()` do get the constrast comparisons. Here's how it works:\n\n* `interaction = \"pairwise\"` specifies that we want to test pairwise contrasts within the interaction, i.e., comparisons at each level of the other variable.\n* `simple = \"each\"` tells R to test each factor separately across the levels of the other factor. If we leave this out, it will test the difference between time points and event types as a single contrast, which isn’t meaningful in this context.\n* `combine = FALSE` ensures that p-value adjustments are applied separately at each level of the other variable. If set to `TRUE`, all comparisons would be pooled and corrected together. You might choose `combine = FALSE` when you’re interested in simple effects (e.g., differences within each condition separately), and `combine = TRUE` when you're making a larger number of comparisons across the full interaction and want a more conservative correction.\n* `adjust = \"bonferroni\"`  specifies the method for correcting multiple comparisons. However, in a 2 × 2 design, if `combine = FALSE`, there is only one comparison per level of the other factor. So no correction is actually applied, as there’s nothing to adjust for.\n\n```{r}\nemmeans(mod, ~ Time_Point*Condition) %>% \n  contrast(interaction = \"pairwise\", \n           simple = \"each\", \n           combine = FALSE, \n           adjust = \"bonferroni\")\n```\n\n### Creating an interaction plot\n\nWhen you have a factorial design, one powerful way of visualising the data is through an interaction plot. This is essentially a line graph where the x-axis has one IV and separate lines for a second IV. However, once you have the factorial ANOVA model, you can add confidence intervals to the plot to visualise uncertainty. The `afex` package has its own function called `afex_plot()` which you can use with the model object you created.\n\nIn the code below, there are a few key argument to highlight:\n\n* `object` is the model you created.\n* `x` is the variable you want on the x-axis.\n* `trace` is the variable you want to plot as separate lines.\n* `error` controls whether the error bars show confidence intervals for between-subjects or within-subjects. In a mixed design, these have different properties, so you must think about which you want to plot and highlight to the reader.\n* `factor_levels` lets you edit the levels of factors you plot, such as renaming or reordering them.\n\nPlus, `afex_plot()` uses `ggplot2` in the background, so you can add layers to the initial function land use `ggsave()` if you wanted to save your plot\n\n```{r}\nafex_plot(object = mod, \n          x = \"Condition\", \n          trace = \"Time_Point\", \n          error = \"between\",\n          factor_levels = list(Time_Point = c(\"Time 1\", \"Time 2\"))) + \n  theme_classic() + \n  scale_y_continuous(breaks = 1:7)\n```\n\n\n### Effect sizes for each comparison\n\nTo calculate standardised effect sizes for the pairwise comparisons, we again need to do this individually using the `cohens_d()` function from the `effectsize` package. Here is where `zhang_data` is becoming useful. \n\nAs we have a mixed design, we must follow a slightly different process for each comparison. Cohen’s d has a different calculation for between-subjects and within-subjects contrasts, so we must express it differently. \n\nFor the first comparison, we are interested in the difference between time 1 and time 2 for each group, so this represents a **within-subjects comparison**.\n\n```{r}\n# time 1 vs time 2 for Extraordinary group\ncohens_d(x = \"Time 1\", \n         y = \"Time 2\", \n         paired = TRUE,\n         data = filter(zhang_data, \n                       Condition == \"Extraordinary\"))\n```\n\n\n```{r}\n# time 1 vs time 2 for Ordinary group\ncohens_d(x = \"Time 1\", \n         y = \"Time 2\", \n         paired = TRUE,\n         data = filter(zhang_data,\n                       Condition == \"Ordinary\"))\n\n```\n\n\nFor the second comparison, we are interested in the difference between ordinary and extraordinary at each time point, so this represents a **between-subjects comparison**.\n\n```{r}\n# Extraordinary vs ordinary at time 1\ncohens_d(`Time 1` ~ Condition,\n         data = zhang_data)\n```\n\n\n```{r}\n# Extraordinary vs ordinary at time 2\ncohens_d(`Time 2` ~ Condition,\n         data = zhang_data)\n\n```\n\n## Activity 9: The write-up\n\nWe can now replicate the write-up paragraph from the paper. However, note we report t-test for the post hoc comparison *(tbh, I have no clue why Zhang et al. decided on ANOVAs reporting when there is only 2 levels to compare)*:\n\nWe conducted the same repeated measures ANOVA with interest as the dependent measure and again found a main effect of time, $F(1, 128) = 25.88, p < .001, η_p^2 = 0.168$; anticipated interest at Time 1 $(M = 4.20, SD = 1.12, 95\\% CI = [4.01, 4.39])$ was lower than actual interest at Time 2 $(M = 4.69, SD = 1.19, 95\\% CI = [4.49, 4.90])$.\n\nWe also observed an interaction between time and type of experience, $F(1, 128) = 4.45, p = .037, η_p^2 = 0.034$. Pairwise comparisons revealed that for ordinary events, predicted interest at Time 1 $(M = 4.04, SD = 1.09, 95\\% CI = [3.76, 4.31])$ was lower than experienced interest at Time 2 $(M = 4.73, SD = 1.24, 95\\% CI = [4.44, 5.03])$, $t(128) = -5.05, p < .001, d = -0.56$. Although predicted interest for extraordinary events at Time 1 $(M = 4.36, SD = 1.13, 95\\% CI = [4.09, 4.63])$ was lower than experienced interest at Time 2 $(M = 4.65, SD = 1.14, 95\\% CI = [4.36, 4.94])$, $t(128) = -2.12, p = .036, d = -0.31$, the magnitude of underestimation was smaller than for ordinary events.\n\n\n\n## [Test your knowledge]{style=\"color: #F39C12; text-transform: uppercase;\"} {.unnumbered}\n\n#### Question 1 {.unnumbered}\n\n**A researcher wants to compare memory test scores across three different age groups (young adults, middle-aged adults, and older adults).

Here, participants can only be allocated to one group.\n* A **Factorial ANOVA** is incorrect because it is used when there are two or more independent variables.\n* A **mixed factorial ANOVA** is incorrect because it is used when there is at least one between-subjects factor and one within-subjects factor.\n\n:::\n\n\n#### Question 2 {.unnumbered}\n\n**A researcher investigates how type of social media use (Passive, Active–Personal, Active–Public) and time of day (Morning vs Evening) affect self-esteem.

Passive users show a positive value (2.00), while both Active-Personal (−2.50) and Active-Public (−1.00) show negative values, indicating higher self-esteem in the evening (i.e., an increase across the day).\n\nIncorrect Answers:\n\n* **Self-esteem increased over the day in all three groups.**: Only the active user groups showed an increase (negative estimates = Evening > Morning). Passive users actually showed a decrease in self-esteem (positive estimate = Morning > Evening).\n* **Only Active users show significant changes in self-esteem over time.**: All three groups show statistically significant changes (p < .05), including Passive users. The difference lies in the direction of change—not whether a change occurred.\n* **You cannot see the directionality of the comparison from the output, only that there is a significant difference.**: The direction is clearly shown by the estimate: positive means higher in the Morning, negative means higher in the Evening. This output lets you interpret both the presence and direction of the effect.\n\n:::\n\n\n\n#### Question 3 {.unnumbered}\n\n**Which of the following is the most appropriate method for checking whether the residuals in a mixed factorial ANOVA are normally distributed?**\n\n`r longmcq(sample(c(answer = \"Generate a Q–Q plot of residuals\", x = \"Use Levene’s Test to compare variance across groups\", x = \"Check whether the independent variable is normally distributed in each condition\", x = \"Visually inspect the spread of data points using a bar chart\")))`\n\n::: {.callout-caution collapse=\"true\" icon=\"false\"}\n\n## Explain this answer\n\nCorrect Answer:\n\n**Generate a Q–Q plot of residuals** is correct because this visual tool helps assess whether the residuals follow a normal distribution. \n\nIncorrect Answers:\n\n* **Use Levene’s Test to compare variance across groups** is incorrect as this checks for homogeneity of variance, not normality.\n* **Check whether the independent variable is normally distributed in each condition** is incorrect because ANOVA assumes that the residuals of the dependent variable, not the independent variable, are normally distributed. The IV is usually categorical and doesn't require normality.\n* **Visually inspect the spread of data points using a bar chart** is incorrect since bar charts show averages, not the distribution of residuals.\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n#### Question 4 {.unnumbered}\n\n**You run a 3 × 4 mixed factorial ANOVA and find a significant interaction. What is the most appropriate next step?**\n\n`r longmcq(sample(c(answer = \"Conduct post hoc comparisons to explore simple effects\", x = \"Interpret only the main effects of each factor\", x = \"Rerun the analysis using a one-way ANOVA for each group\", x = \"Ignore the interaction since it complicates the interpretation\")))`\n\n::: {.callout-caution collapse=\"true\" icon=\"false\"}\n\n## Explain this answer\n\nCorrect Answer:\n\n**Conduct post hoc comparisons to explore simple effects** is correct because a significant interaction suggests that the effect of one factor depends on the level of the other. To fully understand this, you need to explore the simple effects, i.e., how one variable behaves at each level of the other. \n\nIncorrect Answers:\n\n* **Interpret only the main effects of each factor** is incorrect because a significant interaction indicates that the effect of one factor depends on the level of the other. Interpreting main effects alone would be misleading.\n* **Rerun the analysis using a one-way ANOVA for each group** is incorrect as this would ignore the factorial structure and inflate the risk of Type I error. The proper approach is to follow up the interaction with simple effects comparisons, not separate one-way ANOVAs.\n* **Ignore the interaction since it complicates the interpretation** is incorrect because the interaction is a meaningful result. Ignoring it would overlook important patterns in the data and lead to an incomplete or inaccurate interpretation.\n\n:::\n\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":""},"formats":{"html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"html","base-format":"html"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"kable","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":"auto","echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"ipynb-shell-interactivity":null,"plotly-connected":true,"engine":"knitr"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-typ":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":false,"code-overflow":"wrap","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":true,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-min-runs":1,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["https://use.fontawesome.com/releases/v5.13.0/css/all.css","include/booktem.css","include/webex.css","include/glossary.css","include/style.css","include/custom.scss","include/styles.css"],"highlight-style":"a11y","include-after-body":["include/webex.js","include/script.js"],"output-file":"13-factorial-anova.html"},"language":{"toc-title-document":"Table
