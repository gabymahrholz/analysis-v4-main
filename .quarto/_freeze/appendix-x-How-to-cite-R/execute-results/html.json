You should provide separate citations for R, RStudio, and the packages you use.\n\nTo get the citation for the version of R you are using, simply run the `citation()` function which will always provide you with the most recent citation.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncitation()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nTo cite R in publications use:\n\n  R Core Team (2025). _R: A Language and Environment for Statistical\n  Computing_. R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria.\n  <https://www.R-project.org/>.\n\nA BibTeX entry for LaTeX users is\n\n  @Manual{,\n    title = {R: A Language and Environment for Statistical Computing},\n    author = {{R Core Team}},\n    organization = {R Foundation for Statistical Computing},\n    address = {Vienna, Austria},\n    year = {2025},\n    url = {https://www.R-project.org/},\n  }\n\nWe have invested a lot of time and effort in creating R, please cite it\nwhen using it for data analysis. See also 'citation(\"pkgname\")' for\nciting R packages.\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nTo generate the citation for any packages you are using, you can also use the `citation()` function with the name of the package you wish to cite.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncitation(\"tidyverse\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nTo cite package 'tidyverse' in publications use:\n\n  Wickham H, Averick M, Bryan J, Chang W, McGowan LD, François R,\n  Grolemund G, Hayes A, Henry L, Hester J, Kuhn M, Pedersen TL, Miller\n  E, Bache SM, Müller K, Ooms J, Robinson D, Seidel DP, Spinu V,\n  Takahashi K, Vaughan D, Wilke C, Woo K, Yutani H (2019). \"Welcome to\n  the tidyverse.\" _Journal of Open Source Software_, *4*(43), 1686.\n  doi:10.21105/joss.01686 <https://doi.org/10.21105/joss.01686>.\n\nA BibTeX entry for LaTeX users is\n\n  @Article{,\n    title = {Welcome to the {tidyverse}},\n    author = {Hadley Wickham and Mara Averick and Jennifer Bryan and Winston Chang and Lucy D'Agostino McGowan and Romain François and Garrett Grolemund and Alex Hayes and Lionel Henry and Jim Hester and Max Kuhn and Thomas Lin Pedersen and Evan Miller and Stephan Milton Bache and Kirill Müller and Jeroen Ooms and David Robinson and Dana Paige Seidel and Vitalie Spinu and Kohske Takahashi and Davis Vaughan and Claus Wilke and Kara Woo and Hiroaki Yutani},\n    year = {2019},\n    journal = {Journal of Open Source Software},\n    volume = {4},\n    number = {43},\n    pages = {1686},\n    doi = {10.21105/joss.01686},\n  }\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nTo generate the citation for the version of RStudio you are using, you can use the `RStudio.Vesion()` function:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nRStudio.Version()\n```\n:::\n\n\nFinally, here's an example of how that might look in the write-up of your method section:\n\n> Analysis was conducted using R (R Core Team, 2020), RStudio (Rstudio Team, 2020), and the tidyverse package (Wickham, 2017).\n\nAs noted, you may not have to do this for a while, but come back to this when you do because it's important to give the open-source community credit for their work.\n",
