(2018). Have a look at @sec-independent or the SupMats document if you need a refresher on the Simon Task data.\n\n* Open last week's project\n* Create a new `.Rmd` file and save it to your project folder\n* Delete everything after the setup code chunk (e.g., line 12 and below) \n\n\n\n## Activity 2: Library and data for today\n\nToday, we will need the following packages `rstatix`, `tidyverse`, `qqplotr`, `lsr`, and `pwr`. You should have all the necessary packages installed from previous chapters already. If not, you can install them via the console (see @sec-install_packages for more details).\n\nAgain, load the `rstatix` package before `tidyverse`. Then read in the data from `MeansSimonTask.csv` and the demographics information from `DemoSimonTask.csv`.\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# load in the packages\n???\n\n# read in the data\nzwaan_data <- ???\nzwaan_demo <- ???\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.callout-caution collapse=\"true\" icon=\"false\"} \n\n## Solution \n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# load in the packages\nlibrary(rstatix)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(qqplotr)\nlibrary(lsr)\nlibrary(pwr)\n\n# read in the data\nzwaan_data <- read_csv(\"MeansSimonTask.csv\")\nzwaan_demo <- read_csv(\"DemoSimonTask.csv\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n:::\n\n\nAs usual, take some time to familiarise yourself with the data before starting the within-subjects t-test.\n\nToday, we will focus on the Simon effect itself. Remember that the Simon effect predicts shorter response times for congruent trials compared to incongruent trials. Therefore, we are inclined to propose a directional hypothesis.\n\n\n* **Potential research question**: \"Is there a significant difference in response times between congruent and incongruent trials in a Simon task?\"\n* **Null Hypothesis (H~0~)**: \"There is no significant difference in response times between congruent and incongruent trials in a Simon task.\"\n* **Alternative Hypothesis (H~1~)**: \"Response times for congruent trials are significantly shorter than those for incongruent trials in a Simon task.\" or phrased differently \"Participants will respond significantly faster in congruent trials than in incongruent trials in a Simon task.\"\n\n## Activity 3: Preparing the dataframe\n\nAgain, we need to **calculate the mean response time (RT) for both congruent and incongruent trials per participant**. As we did last week, we can also **compute the Simon effect** as the difference score between incongruent and congruent trials.\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\nTo keep all the data in one place, we should join this output with the demographics. While you wonâ€™t need the demographic information for the t-test itself, having it included will give you a complete dataframe. This can be useful when you need to calculate demographics for the Methods section; for example if you end up excluding data points, you can compute sample size, age, and gender splits straight away rather than having to apply the same exclusion criteria to a different data object.\n:::\n\nFor the paired version of the `t.test`, we need the congruent and incongruent trials in separate columns, ensuring **each participant still has only one row in the dataframe** (i.e., **wide format**).

We can confirm that by looking at either the columns `congruent` and `incongruent` in the object `simon_effect`. Or the variable `mean_RT` in `simon_effect_long`. This assumption holds.\n\n\n#### Assumption 2: Data are independent {.unnumbered}\n\nFor a paired t-test this assumption applies to the **pair of values**, i.e., each pair of values needs to be from a separate participant. We assume this assumption holds for our data.\n\n\n\n#### Assumption 3: Normality {.unnumbered}\n\nThis assumption requires the **difference scores** to be approximately normally distributed. We cannot see that from the violin-boxplot above (Option 1) and have to plot the difference score, i.e., variable `simon_effect`.\n\n::: {.callout-note icon=\"false\"} \n\n## Your Turn\n\nPlot the difference score.\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\" icon=\"false\"} \n\n## Hint\n\nThink back to the one-sample t-test.

However, minor deviations from normality are acceptable for t-tests, especially in the tails of the distribution. Therefore, we conclude that the difference scores are approximately normally distributed.\n\n:::\n\n\n:::\n\n\n::: {.callout-note} \n\n\nAssessing normality is never as straightforward as it appears in textbooks. While idealised examples often depict perfectly symmetrical bell curves, real-world data rarely aligns with such precision. Instead, normality exists \"on a spectrum\", and it is your responsibility to evaluate whether the dataâ€™s shape is sufficiently close to normal for the purposes of your analysis.\n\nThis evaluation requires either visual inspection or relying on statistical tests. However, as pointed out in previous chapters, both approaches have limitations and neither provides an absolute answer. Instead of seeking perfection, focus on whether any deviations from normality meaningfully impact the validity of your results.\n\n:::\n\n\n**If any of the assumptions are violated, use the non-parametric equivalent to the paired t-test, see @sec-alternative_paired.**\n\n\n\n\n## Activity 7: Compute a paired t-test and effect size\n\nWe can use the `t.test()` function again to compute the paired t-test. However, we are stuck with the BaseR pattern `data$column` once more. \n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\"} \n## Rant about BaseR and reminiscing about the \"good old days\"\n\nIn case you haven't picked it up by now, I am not much a fan of `data$column` (i.e., wide format) and prefer the `DV ~ IV` (i.e., long format) pattern. And there was a time when the `t.test()` function allowed to add an extra argument `paired = TRUE` to the *formula version* but that is no longer the case. ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ Now, the argument *only* works on the default method, specifying arguments x and y separately. And because the default version doesn't allow us to add a `data = ` argument, we have to revert to `data$column`.\n\nPS: Carolina disagrees with me and prefers some BaseR every now and then. And that's totally fine, too - different researchers and coders have their own preferences, which you may have already noticed in the way you code.\n:::\n\nLong story short, here are the arguments you need from the data object in wide format (in this case data object `simon_effect`):\n\n* `data$column` for condition 1\n* `data$column` for condition 2\n* the extra argument `paired = TRUE` to tell the function we are conducting a paired rather than a two-sample t-test\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nt.test(simon_effect$congruent, simon_effect$incongruent, paired = TRUE)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n\n\tPaired t-test\n\ndata:  simon_effect$congruent and simon_effect$incongruent\nt = -20.161, df = 159, p-value < 2.2e-16\nalternative hypothesis: true mean difference is not equal to 0\n95 percent confidence interval:\n -37.79808 -31.05334\nsample estimates:\nmean difference \n      -34.42571 \n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nThe output tells us pretty much what we need to know:\n\n* the test that was conducted (here a paired t-test),\n* the conditions that were compared (here congruent and incongruent), \n* the t-value, degrees of freedom, and a p-value,\n* the alternative hypothesis, \n* a 95% confidence interval,\n* and the mean difference score between both conditions (which also matches with our descriptives above).\n\n\nThe `t.test()` function does not give us an **effect size**, so, again, we have to compute it ourselves. We can use the `CohensD()` function from the `lsr` package as we did for the one-sample and the two-sample t-test. We can use the formula approach here as well, and add the extra argument `method = \"paired\"`.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncohensD(simon_effect$congruent, simon_effect$incongruent, method = \"paired\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 1.593874\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\n\nThe `cohensD()` function would also take a long format formula approach, such as from `simon_effect_long`, but you would need to make sure that the data within the columns are ordered correctly, i.e., Participant 1: condition 1, condition 2; Participant 2: condition 1, condition 2; etc. If that's not the case, then your results will be wrong.

This will tell us if our analysis was sufficiently powered or not.\n\nThe function we will use again is `pwr.t.test()` from the `pwr` package.

Our actual effect size was 1.59, so this analysis was sufficiently powered. YAY!\n\n## Activity 9: The write-up\n\nWe hypothesised that there would be a significant difference in the response times between congruent $(M = 427.65 msec, SD = 74.17 msec)$ and incongruent trials $(M = 462.08 msec, SD = 74.70 msec)$ of a Simon task. On average, participants were faster in the congruent compared to the incongruent condition $(M_{diff} = 34.43 msec, SD_{diff} = 21.60 msec)$. Using a within-subjects t-test, the effect was found to be significant and of a large magnitude, $t(159) = 20.16, p < .001, d = 1.59$. Therefore, we reject the null hypothesis in favour of H~1~. The analysis was sufficiently powered to detect this effect.\n\n\n## Activity 10: Non-parametric alternative {#sec-alternative_paired}\n\n\nThe **Wilcoxon signed-rank test** is the non-parametric equivalent to the paired t-test, comparing the difference between the median for two measurements. \n\nBefore we compute the test, we need to determine some **summary stats** (e.g., here we focus on the median scores) for the congruent and incongruent conditions. Similar to the One-sample Wilcoxon signed-rank test, we can use the `summary()` function again because our data is in wide format.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsummary(simon_effect)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n participant           gender               age         education        \n Length:160         Length:160         Min.   :19.00   Length:160        \n Class :character   Class :character   1st Qu.:30.75   Class :character  \n Mode  :character   Mode  :character   Median :37.00   Mode  :character  \n                                       Mean   :39.86                     \n                                       3rd Qu.:49.00                     \n                                       Max.   :71.00                     \n  similarity          congruent      incongruent     simon_effect   \n Length:160         Min.   :290.0   Min.   :324.9   Min.   :-18.57  \n Class :character   1st Qu.:379.4   1st Qu.:413.9   1st Qu.: 21.62  \n Mode  :character   Median :411.3   Median :449.7   Median : 34.77  \n                    Mean   :427.7   Mean   :462.1   Mean   : 34.43  \n                    3rd Qu.:458.7   3rd Qu.:496.3   3rd Qu.: 46.22  \n                    Max.   :741.5   Max.   :727.9   Max.   :103.84  \n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nNow we can move on to the **Wilcoxon signed-rank test**.

The order in which you input variables into the function will affect the value of V - has to do with how the ranks are getting assigned. In our column `simon_effect` we subtracted congruent RT from incongruent RT. To have the exact equivalent, we will need to switch the columns in the `wilcox.test()` function. \n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nwilcox.test(simon_effect$incongruent, simon_effect$congruent, paired = TRUE)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n\n\tWilcoxon signed rank test with continuity correction\n\ndata:  simon_effect$incongruent and simon_effect$congruent\nV = 12736, p-value < 2.2e-16\nalternative hypothesis: true location shift is not equal to 0\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nAnd as you can see, the V values match now.\n\n:::\n\n:::\n\nWe should also compute the **standardised test statistic Z**.

Median response times of Congruent trials were significantly faster $(Mdn = 34.77 msec)$ than incongruent trials, $Z = -10.73, p < .001, r = .848$. The difference can be classified as large according to Cohen (1992).

It requires two measurements from the same group or individual. Examples could be before-and-after measurements (e.g., pre- and post-intervention),\nor repeated measures (e.g., exercise under 2 different conditions, such as indoor and outdoor), etc.\n\n\n:::\n\n#### Question 2 {.unnumbered}\n\n**Which of the following is a key assumption of the paired t-test?**\n\n<div class='webex-radiogroup' id='radio_PHFBMZZGPP'><label><input type=\"radio\" autocomplete=\"off\" name=\"radio_PHFBMZZGPP\" value=\"answer\"></input> <span>The differences between paired observations are normally distributed.</span></label><label><input type=\"radio\" autocomplete=\"off\" name=\"radio_PHFBMZZGPP\" value=\"x\"></input> <span>The dependent variable is categorical.</span></label><label><input type=\"radio\" autocomplete=\"off\" name=\"radio_PHFBMZZGPP\" value=\"x\"></input> <span>The two groups have equal variances.</span></label><label><input type=\"radio\" autocomplete=\"off\" name=\"radio_PHFBMZZGPP\" value=\"x\"></input> <span>The two samples are independent.</span></label></div>\n\n\n::: {.callout-caution collapse=\"true\" icon=\"false\"}\n\n## Explain this answer\n\nThe paired t-test assumes that the differences between the paired observations are normally distributed, as the test is applied to these differences, not the raw scores.\n\n:::\n\n\n#### Question 3 {.unnumbered}\n\n**What is the null hypothesis for a paired t-test?**\n\n<div class='webex-radiogroup' id='radio_HDBLPSFQWT'><label><input type=\"radio\" autocomplete=\"off\" name=\"radio_HDBLPSFQWT\" value=\"x\"></input> <span>The means of two independent groups are equal.</span></label><label><input type=\"radio\" autocomplete=\"off\" name=\"radio_HDBLPSFQWT\" value=\"answer\"></input> <span>The differences between paired observations are equal to zero.</span></label><label><input type=\"radio\" autocomplete=\"off\" name=\"radio_HDBLPSFQWT\" value=\"x\"></input> <span>The variances of the two samples are equal.</span></label><label><input type=\"radio\" autocomplete=\"off\" name=\"radio_HDBLPSFQWT\" value=\"x\"></input> <span>There is no relationship between two variables.</span></label></div>\n\n\n::: {.callout-caution collapse=\"true\" icon=\"false\"}\n\n## Explain this answer\n\nThe paired t-test specifically tests whether the mean difference between paired observations (e.g., pre-test and post-test scores) is zero, indicating no systematic difference.\n\nWhy the other options are incorrect:\n\n* **The means of two independent groups are equal**: This describes the null hypothesis for an independent t-test, not a paired t-test. The paired t-test is used for related groups or repeated measures, not independent groups.\n* **The variances of the two samples are equal**: This is an assumption that applies to the independent t-test, which compares two unrelated groups. The paired t-test does not test variances; it focuses on the differences between paired observations.\n* **There is no relationship between two variables**: This is not the null hypothesis for a paired t-test. It relates more to correlation or regression analyses, which assess relationships between variables, not mean differences.\n\n:::\n\n\n\n#### Question 4 {.unnumbered}\n\n**A paired-samples t-test was conducted to compare sleep quality scores with (*M* = 7.5, *SD* = 1.8) and without (*M* = 6.0, *SD* = 1.9) white noise, *t*(29) = 4.55, *p* < .001, *d* = 0.82.

With df = 29, the sample size is 30 participants.\n\nAn effect size of *d* = 0.82 is considered large. This suggests a meaningful and substantial difference in sleep quality between the two conditions.\n\nThe result is statistically significant. The p-value (*p* < .001) indicates that the observed difference in the sample is very unlikely to occur if we assume there is no true difference in the population.\n\nThe mean sleep quality score with white noise (*M* = 7.5) is higher than without white noise (*M* = 6.0), indicating improved sleep quality with white noise.\n\n:::\n",
